# To My Sons - On Blessings and Privilege

Understand that you have many, many blessings.  

These blessings are given to you by God, by your parents, by your parents’ parents, and their parents before them. They’re given to you by your teachers and your mentors and your friends’ parents. They’re given to you by others through your parents, and to you through your life circumstances such as your country of birth, and the actions of your local, regional or federal government, and none of these blessings are things that you control.  

Understand that each of us has our own set of blessings. Some people have many blessings, some have few. The distribution is not at all fair, and it can be hard to understand why some people seem to have so many or so few blessings in their lives.  

Many things in your life will be made easier for you than for others because of your blessings. This is called privilege, and it’s deeply important that you understand the impact privilege has on your life and the lives of those around you.  

It’s much easier to succeed in life if your blessings facilitate success. You were both born in Canada, an affluent country, to two parents who love one-another and who love you. On a very basic level, you had no control whatsoever over those blessings, but they’re yours nonetheless.  

Because you were born in Toronto, Canada, you had access to first-rate medical care as children. You were born into a place where food and fresh water are plentiful, where natural disasters are rare, and where upward social mobility is possible.  

Because you were born to two parents who love one-another and who love you, you’ve had a better opportunity to grow emotionally. You were never subject to, or witness to abuse. You were able to develop trust and compassion and the ability to show affection because these things were modelled for you. 

These are only a few examples of your blessings, but there are many more - your health, your incredible grandparents, your extended family, the fact that your parents had disposable income, the schools you went to as children, the sports and clubs you were a part of. With enough reflection, you’ll likely see that your blessings - these gifts that had formative impacts on the people you are today as you read this - are countless. And each blessing made things easier for you.  

That’s not to say that you haven’t had hardships as well. There will have been things in your life that were difficult - that made things harder than they could have been. But many, if not most of the people you will meet haven’t had as many blessings as you.  

As I said earlier, it’s not fair, but it’s the truth.  

Your responsibility is to acknowledge and appreciate these blessings, and to understand that they were not earned, or deserved by any action of yours. They are yours by chance, and they make you no better or worse a person. 

They are not yours to covet and hide, but to share. Your blessings give you agency and opportunity that others may not have, and your responsibility is to use these blessings and their advantages to be a blessing for others. To
